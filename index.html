            <h2>The Father of Modern Physics</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Albert Einstein</b> (14 March 1879-18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mcÂ², which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

            <h3>Biographies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, to middle-class Jewish parents. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics and science.</li>
                <li>Einstein studied physics and mathematics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. He graduated in 1900.</li>
                <li>In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, not for relativity as commonly believed.</li>
                <li>Published in 1915, this theory expanded on special relativity to include gravity as a geometric property of space-time. It predicted phenomena like gravitational waves and the bending of light.</li>
                <li>Due to rising anti-Semitism, Einstein left Germany in 1933 and settled in the United States, where he became a vocal advocate for civil rights and pacifism.</li>
                <li>Einstein spent the later part of his career searching for a unified field theory but did not succeed. He continued to contribute to theoretical physics and teach at Princeton University.</li>
                <li>Albert Einstein is widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time, known for his intellect, creativity, and impact on our understanding of the universe. His theories continue to influence scientific research and technological advancements today.</li>
